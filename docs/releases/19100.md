# 2019.5.1 Magisk v19.1
Finally, a lovely stable release!

For those that were using v18.1, here are some quick highlights of v19.0

- Imageless Magisk: Although module migration was tested, there are still chances that your modules will get lost in the process. Be prepared to reinstall your existing modules in that case.
- Native 64-bit support
- Zygote Ptrace Based MagiskHide

Other than adding support for Samsung system-as-root devices, this release is mostly bug fixes from v19.0. Enjoy :)
